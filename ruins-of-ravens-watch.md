======================
Custom made beginners dungeon for Pathfinder
See map in page 25 of the Game Master's Guide
Recommended players: 2-3
Recommended level: 2
Total XP: 3140 XP
Approximate time: 5 hours

1. Receiving room (0 XP)
------------------------
“The first thing you notice is two pillars in the middle of the room. The lighting is poor, but you still manage to see fine. You see two small doors to the sides and a big door right in front of you.”

There’s nothing special in this room. You notice that the temperature is a couple of degrees colder than the temperature outside because of the lack of sunlight.

Inspect the south door: "It's looked. You notice a small red dot on top of the key hole".

2. Kitchen (135 XP)
-------------------
“Before you’re even finished opening the door a huge brown and smelly dire rat, the size of a dog, jumps at you. Whoever opened the door is now surprised and can’t do any actions of his/her first move.”

Dire Rat dies: “The rat squeal as it receives a last deadly blow. Dozens of small rats run away from the room where the dire rat came from, passing through your feet and dispersing to the other rooms”

Inspect room: “The smell of rotten meat and wetness makes you sick as soon as you step in. This room seems like it was used as a kitchen. Everything is a mess... cutlery, broken plates and cups are all over the floor.”

Inspect covers: “In one of the covers, you notice something that seems like it was put there recently, you take a closer look and you find a key, a pill and a note beside it — Beware! Extremely potent pill for sedating big creatures. Handle with care!”

Finds:
  * Sedative pill with a note
  * Blue Key

3. Interrogation room (270 XP)
------------------------------
“Goosebumps run through your body as you open the door. Something doesn’t feel right here. A chair in the middle of the room and some torture tools scattered all over the floor indicate that this room was once used for interrogating criminals and prisoners.”

Inspect room: “The corner of what seems to be a glittering wooden box right around the left hidden space catches your eyes. You also notice the bones of who once were two people laying against the first pillar, looks like they’ve been dead for over 100 years.”

Skeletons attack only if you pass right beside them, otherwise they're just old dead bones.

Adjacent to skeletons: “Something grabs your leg! You look down and one of the skeletons is grabbing your leg so hard that your can feel your foot painfully pulsing from the lack of blood.”

Character is surprised and grabbed (can't move) until the skeleton’s next turn.

PCs can do a perception check before they go in the room:
  * 0-20: You feel the goosebumps again
  * > 21: The skeletons are not dead

Treasure:
  * 250 GP
  * Potion: Cure light wounds x1 (50 GP)
  * Eradicate Magic[1]

[1] Eradicate Magic: A strong potion that eradicates magic from clerics and wizards that follow Lamashtu. This is a thrown weapon. Make a ranged touch attack. If you hit, the target can't cast ANY kind of magic for the next 1d4+1 turns. (This potion can only be used in this dungeon)

4. Prisoner's room (135 XP)
---------------------------
"BAAM! You whole body shakes as you feel a huge bang on the door. Through a small window in the door, a huge beast with a green face and piercing eyes looks right at you. Only the door separates you and the beast by couple of inches. While he looks at you he screams — AHHHHH YOU STUPID MORON! I'M GOING TO EAT YOUR FACE WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE! LET ME OUT!" - as he keeps heavily banging on the door.

Inspect through window: "You notice that the beast is an orc. Feared creatures born to be warriors. This orc looks a bit skinnier that most orcs you've seen before."

"The door seems to be locked, but it has a blue dot on top of where the key goes. Going in that room with an enraged orc of that size doesn't seem like the best idea."

Talking to orc through window: PCs can't get the Orc to listen, he screams - AT LEAST GIVE ME SOME FOOD YOU BASTARDS!

The PCs must mix the _Sedative Pill_ found in room #2 with a _Trail Ration_ (in adventurer's kit) and give it to the ogre.

Giving food to the orc: "They pass the pill mixed with food under the door. The orc finally stays quiet while he eats the food that you gave him. You way 5 minutes and see through the window how his face instantly relaxes. The huge and scary orc, now has droopy eyes and a small smirk on his face."

If the PCs try to go in room before giving the pill to the orc, the orc attacks. Try to get PCs to find a way around before letting them go in the room. You can hint that the orc looks hungry or thirsty and he doesn't seem to be calming down.

If the PCs try to talk to the Orc after giving him the pill, the orc tells says: "I remember small purple demon hiting in head and bring here. If you fight with purple demon throw _Holy Water_ to face."

5. Old prisoner's belongings (0 XP)
-----------------------------------
This is just an empty room — "You find 300 GP on the floor."

6. Another prisoner's room (0 XP)
---------------------------------
"This room was once used as a prison for prisoners with good behavior. They had their own bed and even a desk! The room is all dusty and hasn't been used in years"

Inspect drawers: "Searching the drawers you notice that there's something on the top part of one of the them. You take it out and it's a _Red Key_. You wonder what this key opens."

Secret door: DC 15 Perception

7. Secret passage (0 XP)
------------------------
"This passage was digged by the last prisoner that occupied this room as a way to get out of prison. It's completely dark, it smells like wet dirt and it's filled with nasty spider webs."

Inspect walls: 
"You notice that somebody wrote in chalk a sequence of numberes: 6 4 4 9 2 2 8"

8. Guards room (0 XP)
---------------------
"This room was once a place where guards stood to guard the cells. Straight ahead you see the cells where prisoners used to live in. It surprises you how clean this room is after so many years of it not being used."

"To the right you see a big door, although it seems to be locked. There's also a desk in the middle of the room and a door right behind it."
